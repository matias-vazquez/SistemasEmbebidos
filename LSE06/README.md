# C Programming and I<sup>2</sup>C interfacing in Arduino Zero

## Objectives
* Strengthen your knowledge and abilities about C programming and serial communication protocols, specifically I<sup>2</sup>C. 
* Learn how to program timers and develop interfaces to I<sup>2</sup>C peripherals specifically the real time clock (RTC).

## Introduction
This lab provides you the opportunity to learn how to develop embedded software applications by following the steps and practices commonly used in industry. In this lab, you will learn to write C language code using the header files and source files provided by ATMEL. Your will also develop your own header and source files to access and manipulate a real time clock. This lab will also provide you the opportunity to strengthen your knowledge about the i2c protocol by programming an interface to the real time clock and by observing and measuring timing of the i2c signals using the oscilloscope. The oscilloscope for this lab has additional software licenses (and expensive) software to show a decoded view of the i2c signals.

          	//Enabling the TC3 peripheral
                 	LDR  R1, [R3]    	//reads CTRLA

          	//Loop to sync the TC clock with the processor/main clock
                 	LDR  R4, =0x80   	//mask value
read:     	   	LDRB R1, [R3, #0x0F] //reads STATUS

again:    	   	    LDRB R1, [R3, #0x0E] //reads the INTFLAG
                 	ANDS R1, R1, R5  	//to test OVF flag

                 	B	again

```
1. Use the [SAMD21 microcontroller datasheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ioVVR1NGN9EGv17DAQoz2EE7NLV9ePyL/view?usp=sharing) to explain the procedure to configure the timer. List the different &mu;C registers, the values assigned to each register and the corresponding configuration. 

2. Translate the assembly language instructions into C language statements. Use the following files to identify the structures in which the timer registers are located.

5.	Create a new project in Atmel Studio and copy the provided code. Run the program step by step.

    1. Open a project in ATMEL Studio
        1. Select the GCC C Executable version
        2. Change the GCCApplicationX  name to your prefered name.
        3. Double click at the application main.c file at the “Solution Explorer”. The text editor will become open and you are ready to write the code.

    2. After executing the program step by step and before starting the “sending sequence”, what are the values “to be sent” to the RTC?. These values are located at the tx_buf[] buffer. Demonstrate to the professor that you can read these values using the Debugger.

    3. Review the code and explain using an activity diagram the steps needed to write values to the RTC and the steps needed to read information from the RTC. Report these diagrams.

    4. What memory locations of the RTC were written? and what are the values at these locations after completing the “sending sequence”? Report this findings.

    5. After executing the “receiving sequence”, were the values correctly recovered?. Report the recovered values. 

    6. What is the purpose of the code “RELOCATING POINTER BEFORE RECEIVING”? If you write comments to this code, is the code working as expected? Report your explanation and findings. 

6.	Test a sample program to display information at the windows terminal (Putty).

    2. Open the putty application on the computer.

    3. Report the schematic diagram between the Arduino Zero and the FTDI.

  <img src="img/putty_04.png">
</p>

    8. Add a “Hello World” printf to the program and run the program (using the debugger) to demonstrate to the professor that the information is being displayed on the Terminal. Add an image of the terminal with the “Hello World”.

7. Using C language unions and structures, define structures to access/manipulate the information of the RTC. These structures/unions should be located at the “RTCControl.h” file. Report your .h file with comments.

### Example
```C
#define MONTH_ADDR 0x05
typedef union {
    struct  { 
        uint8_t un_month  	:4,
         	    dec_mont    :1,
                RESERVED    :3;
    } field;
    uint8_t reg;
} month_type;
```
Remember that header files have the following directives at the beginning and end of the file in order to prevent compilation errors. 
```C
#ifndef RTCCONTROL_H_               /*this goes at the top of the document”
#define RTCCONTROL_H_
 
#endif /*RTCCONTROL_H_*/          /*this goes at the bottom of the document”
```

8. Modify the provided code to incorporate the following C functions. Write the function prototype definitions at the “RTCControl.h” file. Write the body of the functions at the “RTCControl.c” file.
    1. ```void sendI2CDataArray(SlAddr, ptr, ptrData, Size)```
        
        This function writes the data located in the array to the RTC.

        ```SlAddr``` is the slave address, ```ptr``` is the address for the internal pointer of the RTC, ```ptrData``` is a pointer to the 8-bit data array, and ```Size``` is the number of elements in the array.
    2. ```void SendI2CData(Data)```

      	```Data``` is the 8-bit data to send.  
    3. void StopCond()
      	
          Function to generate a stop condition.
    4. ```void receiveI2CDataArray(SlAddr, ptr, ptrData, Size)```

         This function reads the data from the RTC and stores this data at the Data array.
    
        ```SlAddr``` is the slave address, ```ptr``` is the address for the internal pointer of the RTC, ```ptrData``` is a pointer to the 8-bit data array, and ```Size``` is the number of elements in the array.

 9. Rewrite the provided program and develop an application that does the following.
    1. The program should initialize the RTC with the current time and date only once.

    2. The program should display the RTC time in your PC at the terminal (Putty) all the time. 

    To do this you will need:

    * Include the new .h files (you can drag the files into the project (project name)).
    * Modify the main program to include calls to the functions that you develop in item 8.
    * To “print” to the terminal the information coming from the real time clock using one-line message similar (Also known as TIMESTAMP) to this:

	    Date/Month/Year/Hours/Seconds/Minutes

    To print the month you may type:

    ```myprintf(“%d%d/”, xRTC.DATE.field.dec_month, xRTC.DATE.field.un_month);```

10.	Demonstrate to the professor that your new code works and explain the structure of your new code.
