# Laboratory of Embedded Systems - Final Project Proposal

## Background
In this final project, you will implement the learned skills throughout the semester in a comprehensive implementation of an embedded system. In this sense, in this document you will first propose the development of a system of your choice 

## Requirements

1. Work in teams (2 maximum)
2. Three weeks of work divided in 4 lab sessions (November 12, 16, 19 and 23), and independent work from November 23 to December 3. 
3. The proposed system scope is delimited by hardware requirements described in this document 
4. A project presentation, along with a technical report are required as deliverable products of your development. The project presentation will be held on Friday, December 3 (time to be determined). Technical report turn in is required for the final presentation. 
5. Final project will be graded as follows (30% of the Laboratory final grade):

## Project Proposal
Write a formal project proposal that details the project you will to develop throughout the three weeks, comprising November 12 to December 3, 2021. Include in your document the following sections:

1. Overview
    - Describe in one paragraph what you would like to develop as a final project in general terms. Include the platflorm you will use (Raspberry Pi or Arduino Zero), additional hardware, as well as the coding language for development.
    - Breakdown your project into specific tasks to be accomplished separately. Include a block diagram of the system, showing the data flow through each block. 
        - Drivers/controllers (7-segment displays, VGA, servomotors, sensors, etc.)
        - Encoders/decoders 
        - Communication modules (serial, wireless, etc.)

3. Work plan
    - A __Schematic diagram__ of the proposed system, including your main platform (Raspberry Pi or Arduino Zero) additional peripherals, as required by your application. Show the wiring and pin names for each peripheral attached to the your main platform. 
    - A __Gantt diagram__, considering:
        - 3 working weeks (November 12 to December 3)
        - Project responsabilities for each team member (both team members must contribute in code development)
        - A 10 minutes final presentation (December 3) including a 5 minute project explanation and 5 minute live demonstration. 

## Hardware requirements
Your embedded system must be coded either in C, Assembly, Python, or a combination of the three languages. The minimum hardware requirements that your integrated system must fulfill are the following:
1. __Raspberry Pi 3 Model B or Arduino Zero__

2. __Input peripherals (at least two)__
    - Temperature sensor
    - SD card
    - GPS module
    - Infrared sensor
    - RFID reader/Tag
    - 4x4 Keypad
    - Touch sensor
    - Relay
    - Others as suggested...

3. __Output peripheral__
    - VGA display
    - LCD display (16x2 or higher resolution)
    - Servo motor
    - Others as suggested...
