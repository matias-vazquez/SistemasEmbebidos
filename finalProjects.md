# Laboratory of Embedded Systems - Final Project

## Project Proposal
Write a formal project proposal that details the project you will to develop throughout the four weeks comprising from May 7 to June 1, 2021. Include in your document the following sections:

1. Overview
    - Describe in one paragraph what you would like to develop as a final project in general terms. 
    - Breakdown your project from general terms into specific tasks to be accomplished as a process, to carry out the overall purpose of your project.
    - Include a block diagram of the process to be followed (tasks) to accomplish the general purpose of the project.
2. Motivation
    - Explain how your proposed project contributes by adding value to solve an specific problem in a community (_e.g.,_ improving learning process of children in the classroom, protecting the elder from a particular disease, teaching braille reading to blind people, etc.). 
3. Work plan
    - Draw an __schematic diagram__ of the proposed system, including your main platform (Raspberry Pi or Arduino Zero) additional peripherals, as required by your application. Show the wiring and pin names for each peripheral attached to the your main platform. 
    - Layout the file tree to be implemented in your project, including your main routine and additional instances. 
    - Also, include a __Gantt diagram__, considering:
        - 4 working weeks (May 7 to June 1)
        - Project responsabilities for each team member (all team members must contribute in code development)
        - A 10 minutes final presentation (June 4) including a 5 minute project explanation and 5 minute live demonstration. 

## Hardware requirements
Your embedded system must be coded either in C, Assembly, Python, or a combination of the three languages. The minimum hardware requirements that your integrated system must fulfill are the following:
1. __Raspberry Pi 3 Model B or Arduino Zero__

2. __Suggested peripherals__
    - Temperature sensor
    - Real time clock
    - SD card
    - GPS module
    - Infrared sensor
    - 4x4 Keypad
    - Touch sensor
    - Servo motor
    - Relay
    - Others as required...
